## Setup

To run locally, make sure you have the following installed:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): Either install it locally or set up a database in the cloud and get the database URL.
* Set up a Slack app. This

Once you have these, you'll need to `git clone` this repo, and then:

1. `yarn install`
2. Fill out `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`.
